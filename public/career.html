I need to understand dependencies, document them, and ensure that eveyone is on board with the vision. As I wrapped up my time in Servicing we were able to take our years of progress with modernizing our Call Center technology, and <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/black-knight-buys-a-piece-of-quicken-loans-award-winning-mortgage-servicing-software/">sell that tech</a> to the leading tech provider of Mortgage Servicing software. I ensured that the sale went smoothly and worked with another large Enterprise to make sure everything went smoothly. I moved over from Servicing to <a href="https://www.rocketprotpo.com/">Rocket Pro TPO</a> to help modernize the Wholesale mortgage space. I help lead a Release Train as an Architect and help define best practices, define the architecture for Features, and deal with the hard issues that come up. I've also gotten back into working within the Salesforce ecosystem, so I use my knowledge of the platform to ensure that we do the right thing. I also feel very strongly that for Architects to be effective, they cannot stop writing code. To that end I pitch in with features and issues wherever possible so that I don't lose my coding chops at all. I also keep tinkering with new tech so that I can understand what is practical and what isn't.

I spent a lot of time making "DevOps" a reality. This involved sitting with the Ops teams and learning Networking, Principal of least privilige, and understanding Docker, while explaining Dev practices as well. I also helped define the CI/CD process using CircleCI integrating with pipelines, and defining the checks within those pipelines. Integration testing, load testing, and obviously unit testing. I helped build the first application in my space which had a Database hosted in AWS, and document and fix all the challenges that arose along with that. This application tracks all of our Client interactions, and has tracked 10's of millions of interactions in a threaded view so Team Members on the phone can quickly follow a thread of an issue across multiple mediums. I helped the team by laying down a path that others could walk on to repeat our Cloud journey.  I had to work with BI teams to get this data into our Data Warehouse and Data Lake. I led meetings across my entire stream (~100 Engineers) and helped set and define standards and tooling. </span>

I learned how to shadow Team Members and make changes to the software to allow them to move faster, and have a better UX.
